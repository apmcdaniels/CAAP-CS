Task 6

To change the commit message w/o creating another commit, I used the following command:
git commit --amend

this command took me to the "window" of the terminal that comes up whenever I run:
git commit

I got this info. from https://help.github.com/en/articles/changing-a-commit-message

Task 7

At this point I've been unable to locate the commit with the --no-mouse option.  After cloning the repository onto my laptop, I changed my directory to the fzf folder and ran "git log" to look through the commits.  I ran "git show COMMIT_SHA" for every logged commit, but was unable to find the --no-mouse in any of them
