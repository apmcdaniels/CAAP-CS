Task 6

To change the commit message w/o creating another commit, I used the following command:
git commit --amend

this command took me to the "window" of the terminal that comes up whenever I run:
git commit

Task 7

At this point I've been unable to locate the commit with the --no-mouse option.  After cloning the repository onto my laptop, I changed my directory to the fzf folder and ran "git log" to look through the commits.  I ran "git show COMMIT_SHA" for every logged commit, but was unable to find the --no-mouse in any of them

Task 8

I ran the command "git diff" to see the changes made to the READMe.txt relative to the last commit.
