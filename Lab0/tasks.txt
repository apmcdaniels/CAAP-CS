Task 6

To change the commit message w/o creating another commit, I used the following command:
git commit --amend

this command took me to the "window" of the terminal that comes up whenever I run:
git commit
I got this info. from https://help.github.com/en/articles/changing-a-commit-message

Task 7

At this point I've been unable to locate the commit with the --no-mouse option.  After cloning the repository onto my laptop, I changed my directory to the fzf folder and ran "git log" to look through the commits.  I ran "git show COMMIT_SHA" for every logged commit, but was unable to find the --no-mouse in any of them

Task 8

I ran the command "git diff" to see the changes made to the READMe.txt relative to the last commit.

Task 9

In order to create a commit that deleted the mistake.txt w/o deleting the history, I ran the command "git revert HEAD"

Task 10

At first, I attempted to run git revert for the 2 commits that had the mistakes in them by typing the command: git revert 732e28e a679b2f --no-commit

When I did this, something went wrong! the commit 732e28e came up as un-merged.  to solve this, I ran "git revert --abort" to cancel the reversion. I then switched up my approach and ran the command twice:
git revert HEAD -n
git revert 732e28eb166470e5fbe033db6a571174f351da4d -n

I then created a single commit for the two reversions.  Even though I ultimately had to run the revert command twice, I still understood how to use the command for multiple commits.
