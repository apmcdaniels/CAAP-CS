Comments:
	-P5: fibonnaci sequence is not called and therefore doesn't run
		-It asks user for number at every recursive call (user is unaware of what's happening)
	-P6: Change function doesn't cover some edge cases (e.g. 0.009999999 should return 1 coin)
	-P7: Q2 asks for an alternative method, not how well a greedy algorithm would work.

	-Your README should include how you run your specific program, what version of python you are using, and explanation of what each of your programs do.
	-MAKE SURE TO DOCUMENT ALL OF YOUR CODE!
