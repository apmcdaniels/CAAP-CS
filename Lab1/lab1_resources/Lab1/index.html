            From and early age, Akwe McDaniels knew that fruits had something special to offer to the human world.  As she grew older and more observant of the world around her, she noticed how fresh fruits sometimes got a bad rep.  Determined to change the way we view fruit in our society, she started <em>All About FRUIT</em>, a blog which explores fruit from every imaginable angle.  In doing so, she is showing fruit for what it is: delicious, nutricious, accessible, and easy!
